# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-TensorFlow-and-Keras
This project implements a handwritten digit classification model using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it achieves digit classification through a simple neural network architecture. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, labeled from 0 to 9.
